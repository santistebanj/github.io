    <h2>Innovative Ideas for: Innovation process of a Technology Development Center</h2>
    
    <h3><span class="pattern">1. Subtraction:</span> Removing an essential component</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No-budget innovation: Implement a "zero-budget" innovation challenge where teams must create new technologies using only existing resources and open-source tools, fostering extreme creativity and resourcefulness.
        <p class="evaluation">Evaluation: High feasibility and strategic fit, as it encourages resourcefulness and cost-efficiency. However, market need and financial viability may be limited due to potential resource constraints. Impact could be significant in fostering a culture of frugal innovation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Leaderless innovation sprints: Remove traditional project managers and instead use a rotating leadership model where team members take turns leading weekly sprints, encouraging diverse perspectives and shared responsibility.
        <p class="evaluation">Evaluation: High potential for impact on team dynamics and creativity. Feasibility is moderate, requiring careful implementation. Strategic fit depends on organizational culture. Market need is high as companies seek more agile and inclusive innovation processes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Silent brainstorming: Conduct idea generation sessions without verbal communication, using only visual aids and written notes to eliminate groupthink and empower introverted team members.
        <p class="evaluation">Evaluation: High feasibility and low cost make this idea financially viable. Strategic fit is good for organizations looking to diversify idea sources. Market need is moderate, as many companies seek ways to improve brainstorming effectiveness. Impact could be significant in generating more diverse ideas.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3><span class="pattern">2. Multiplication:</span> Copying an element with or without variation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Multi-center collaboration: Create multiple "mini" technology development centers within the main center, each focusing on a different industry or technology domain, fostering healthy internal competition and specialized expertise.
        <p class="evaluation">Evaluation: High potential for impact and strategic fit, especially for large organizations. Feasibility may be challenging due to resource requirements. Market need is high as companies seek ways to specialize while maintaining collaboration. Financial viability depends on the organization's size and resources.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Innovation time multiplier: Implement a "20% time" policy where employees can work on personal projects, but with a twist - they can "multiply" their innovation time by recruiting colleagues to join their projects, creating organic, cross-functional teams.
        <p class="evaluation">Evaluation: High strategic fit for companies valuing employee-driven innovation. Market need is high as organizations seek to boost creativity and employee satisfaction. Feasibility and financial viability may vary depending on workload and project success rates. Potential for high impact on innovation culture.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Parallel prototyping: Develop multiple prototypes for each project simultaneously, using different approaches or technologies, then combine the best elements from each to create superior final products.
        <p class="evaluation">Evaluation: High potential for impact on product quality and innovation speed. Market need is high in fast-paced technology sectors. Feasibility and financial viability may be challenging due to increased resource requirements. Strategic fit is strong for organizations prioritizing rapid, high-quality innovation.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3><span class="pattern">3. Division:</span> Dividing an element and rearranging it</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Modular innovation process: Break down the innovation process into distinct, interchangeable modules (e.g., ideation, prototyping, testing) that can be rearranged or repeated as needed for each project, allowing for a more flexible and tailored approach.
        <p class="evaluation">Evaluation: High strategic fit for organizations seeking to improve innovation process flexibility. Market need is high as companies look for ways to adapt to diverse project requirements. Feasibility is good, with potential challenges in implementation. Financial viability is strong due to improved efficiency. Impact could be significant in optimizing innovation processes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Distributed expertise network: Divide the center's expertise into a network of remote specialists who collaborate virtually, allowing for a wider talent pool and 24/7 innovation cycle across time zones.
        <p class="evaluation">Evaluation: High market need in the era of remote work and global talent acquisition. Feasibility may be challenging due to coordination complexities. Financial viability is strong, potentially reducing overhead costs. Strategic fit is high for organizations looking to expand their talent pool. Impact could be substantial in accelerating innovation and accessing diverse expertise.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Micro-innovation sprints: Split large projects into a series of week-long micro-sprints, each focusing on a specific feature or problem, allowing for rapid iteration and frequent reassessment of project direction.
        <p class="evaluation">Evaluation: High feasibility and strategic fit for organizations adopting agile methodologies. Market need is high as companies seek ways to increase development speed and adaptability. Financial viability is strong due to potentially reduced waste and faster time-to-market. Impact could be significant in improving project success rates and team morale.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3><span class="pattern">4. Task Unification:</span> Assigning additional tasks to an element</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Client-integrated development: Embed clients directly into the innovation teams, having them work alongside developers and researchers, ensuring real-time feedback and market alignment while also educating clients on emerging technologies.
        <p class="evaluation">Evaluation: High potential for impact on product-market fit and client relationships. Market need is high as companies seek closer alignment with client needs. Feasibility may be challenging due to client availability and willingness. Financial viability is strong, potentially reducing rework and improving client retention. Strategic fit is high for organizations prioritizing client-centric innovation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Innovation space as a living lab: Transform the physical environment of the center into a testbed for new technologies, where everyday operations serve as continuous real-world testing for innovations in areas like IoT, energy efficiency, and workspace optimization.
        <p class="evaluation">Evaluation: High strategic fit for technology centers looking to showcase their innovations. Market need is moderate to high, especially for B2B tech companies.
